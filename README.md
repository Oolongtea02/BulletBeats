# Bullet Beats

This is my individual prototype created using the CrispGameLib (Javascript) for the UCSC CMPM 170 course on Rapid Prototyping. 
The game uses bullets as a one button mechanic and makes player vs enemy behavior in a pixelated setting.

Here is the documentation for making a game with Crisp: https://github.com/abagames/crisp-game-lib and https://github.com/JunoNgx/crisp-game-lib-tutorial.git.
